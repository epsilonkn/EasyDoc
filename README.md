# Doc

**Welcome to the page of the EasyDoc project**

The idea of that package is to create a technical documentation from the docstrings and the commentary in the source code : yes, the more you comment your code, the more the packge will scrap

## To use it : 

### Command Line :

### in a python program

Disclaimer : Running the module in a program by calling directly the classes can be possible, but this might also opens a pandora box of bugs


## Next updates :

Soon comming...


## API :
